üîç Project Title: Clustering Techniques for Data Science Insights
Description:

This project explores and implements a wide range of clustering algorithms using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, SciPy, and other specialized tools. The goal is to analyze, segment, and uncover hidden patterns in complex datasets through unsupervised learning.

Key components include:

Algorithm Implementation:

KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, OPTICS, and Birch via scikit-learn

Hierarchical clustering using scipy.cluster.hierarchy

Optional: Advanced methods like HDBSCAN and KMedoids via sklearn-extra

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

Scalable data normalization, dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA, t-SNE), and handling of missing values.

Evaluation & Visualization:

Use of silhouette scores, Davies‚ÄìBouldin index, and inertia metrics.

Visual diagnostics with matplotlib, seaborn, and dimensionality reduction for cluster visualization.

Use Cases Explored:

Customer segmentation

Anomaly detection

Pattern discovery in high-dimensional data

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering in data science workflows and provides reusable, modular code suitable for real-world applications.
